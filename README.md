# Simplike

An algorithm based on the simplex method for solving linear programs. Unlike the standard simplex method, which works on linear programs in standard equality form (Ax = b, x >= 0), this method works on polyhedra of the form Ax <= b.

I developed the algorithm while taking an Introduction to Optimization class in order to better understand the Simplex algorithm.
